# Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3

Models for the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 Concept, part of _European Train Control System_ integrated in the the _European Rail Traffic Management System_. The model is based on the design [principles](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/assets/sharepoint/groupsite/Academic/ABZ-Coneference-2018/Public%20Documents/ABZ2018/16E0421A_HL3.pdf) provided in the call for case study submission of [ABZ'18](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/abz2018/).  

The description of the models, as well as the modelling approach, is available in this [conference paper](https://nmacedo.github.io/pubs/ABZ18a.pdf) and its [journal paper](https://nmacedo.github.io/pubs/STTT19.pdf) extension. Additional information, as well as the result of the operational scenarios, is available [here](https://github.com/haslab/Electrum/wiki/ERTMS).

The original model, as published in ABZ'18, was developed for version [1A](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/assets/sharepoint/groupsite/Academic/ABZ-Coneference-2018/Public%20Documents/ABZ2018/16E0421A_HL3.pdf) of the design principles. A new version [1C](https://ertms.be/sites/default/files/2018-07/16E0421C_HL3-clean.pdf) was eventually released, which was considered for the extended version of the paper for STTT. The two versions are available in Electrum for historical reasons.

Although these models were initially developed for Electrum 1, they have been updated for Electrum 2.1. Legacy versions are available [here](https://github.com/nmacedo/MSV/commit/7425ce6d135bb685aa09e10be637e84c85547ba0).

# Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3

Models for the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 Concept, part of _European Train Control System_ integrated in the the _European Rail Traffic Management System_. The model is based on the design [principles](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/assets/sharepoint/groupsite/Academic/ABZ-Coneference-2018/Public%20Documents/ABZ2018/16E0421A_HL3.pdf) provided in the call for case study submission of [ABZ'18](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/abz2018/).  

The description of the models, as well as the modelling approach, is available in this [conference paper](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/papers/abz18.pdf) and its [journal paper](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/papers/sttt19.pdf) extension. Additional information, as well as the result of the operational scenarios, is available [here](https://github.com/haslab/Electrum/wiki/ERTMS).

The original model, as published in ABZ'18, was developed for version [1A](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/assets/sharepoint/groupsite/Academic/ABZ-Coneference-2018/Public%20Documents/ABZ2018/16E0421A_HL3.pdf) of the design principles. A new version [1C](https://ertms.be/sites/default/files/2018-07/16E0421C_HL3-clean.pdf) was eventually released, which was considered for the extended version of the paper for STTT. The two versions are available in Electrum for historical reasons.

### History

* Version 1A is described in the ABZ'18 paper [_Validating the Hybrid ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 Concept with Electrum_](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/papers/abz18.pdf) and version 1C in its [extended version](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/papers/sttt19.pdf) in the STTT journal.
* Electrum models were initially developed for _Electrum 1.1_, and have since been updated for _Electrum 2.1_. Legacy versions are available [here](https://github.com/nmacedo/MSV/tree/7879be4dd1c4cc5a3883fb7413dc1979e8204a7d/CaseStudies/ERTMS).
* Version 1A was used in the benchmarks of the ASE'18 tool demo [_The Electrum Analyzer: Model checking relational first-order temporal specifications_](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/papers/ase18tool.pdf).
* These models was used as an example in a tutorial on [_Formal software design with Alloy and Electrum_](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/tutorial.html) at FM'19, in the session on [Methodology and Tips](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/slides/session5.pdf).
* A simplified version of these models was used as a running example in the F-IDE'18 paper [_Improving the Visualization of Alloy Instances_](http://haslab.github.io/TRUST/papers/fide18.pdf).

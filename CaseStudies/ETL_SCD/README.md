# Slowly changing dimension ETL pattern

A formalization of the [Slowly Changing Dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension) with history maintenance (SCD-H) in [Extract, Transform, Load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) (ETL) processes often used in data warehousing.

### Description

The model
* formalizes data objects and mappings between them
* formalizes the structure of the SCD-H ETL pattern
* it models some of the operations required by SCD-H

### Development history

* These models have been originally developed for the MEDI'16 paper *[Towards a formal validation of ETL patterns behavior](http://nmacedo.github.io/pubs.html#medi16)*.
* Alloy models have been developed and analyzed under the *Alloy Analyzer 4.2_2015-02-22*.

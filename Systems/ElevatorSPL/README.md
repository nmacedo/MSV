# Elevator system SPL

### History
* This example is based on the benchmarks from the paper *Symbolic Model Checking of Software Product Lines* by A. Classen and A. Legay, itself adapted from *Feature integration using a feature construct* by M. Plath and M. Ryan.
* The model has been used as a running example and in the benchmarks of the FSE'16 *[Lightweight specification and analysis of dynamic systems with rich configurations](http://nmacedo.github.io/pubs.html#fse16)* paper.
* Alloy models have been developed and analyzed under the *Alloy Analyzer 4.2_2015-02-22*.
* Electrum models have been developed and analyzed under the *Electrum Analyzer 0.1*., and subsequently tested for support under version *1.2*.

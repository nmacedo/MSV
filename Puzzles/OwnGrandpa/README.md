# I'm my own grandpa

Models for solving the "I'm My Own Grandpa" riddle.

### Description

A model of the song "[I'm My Own Grandpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_My_Own_Grandpa)" by Dwight B. Latham and Moe Jaffe, with minor adaptations from the model that comes packaged with the Alloy Analyzer, proposed by D. Jackson in _Software Abstractions: Logic, Language, and Analysis_.

The models try to solve whether it is possible for someone to be their own grandpa, given different assumptions.

### Development history
* The original model, by Daniel Jackson, is a running example in the book *Software Abstractions: Logic, Language, and Analysis* and is distributed with the Alloy Analyzer.
* This model is slight variation of the original, and has been used to illustrate the FASE'15 *[Exploring scenario exploration](http://nmacedo.github.io/pubs.html#fase15)* paper.
* Alloy models have been developed and analyzed under the *Alloy Analyzer 4.2_2015-02-22*.

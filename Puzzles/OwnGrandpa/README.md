# I'm my own grandpa

Models for solving the "I'm My Own Grandpa" riddle.

### Description

Models of the song "[I'm My Own Grandpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_My_Own_Grandpa)" by Dwight B. Latham and Moe Jaffe, with minor adaptations from the model that comes packaged with the Alloy Analyzer, proposed by D. Jackson in _Software Abstractions: Logic, Language, and Analysis_.

The models try to solve whether it is possible for someone to be their own grandpa, given different assumptions.

An extended version with multiple variants is also available, where different assumptions are introduced as features.

### Development history
* The original model, by Daniel Jackson, is a running example in the book *Software Abstractions: Logic, Language, and Analysis* and is distributed with the Alloy Analyzer.
* The Alloy model is a slight variation of the original, and has been used to illustrate the FASE'15 *[Exploring scenario exploration](http://nmacedo.github.io/pubs.html#fase15)* paper.
* The Colorful Alloy model extends the original with different assumptions, and has been used in the benchmarks of the SETTA'19 *[Simplifying the analysis of software design variants with a colorful](http://nmacedo.github.io/pubs.html#setta19)* paper.
* Alloy models have been developed and analyzed under the *Alloy Analyzer 4.2_2015-02-22*.
* Colorful Alloy models have been developed and analyzed under first release of *Colorful Alloy Analyzer (July 2019)*.

# Spanning tree algorithm 

Models of a [spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) algorithm, inspired by the version distributed with the Alloy Analyzer,

### Description

### Development history
* The original model is distributed with the Alloy Analyzer.
* The Alloy/Electrum models are a slight variation of the original, and have been used in the benchmarks of the FSE'16 *[Lightweight specification and analysis of dynamic systems with rich configurations](http://nmacedo.github.io/pubs.html#fse16)* paper.
* The TLA+ model is also inspired by the the original Alloy model.
* Alloy models have been developed and analyzed under the *Alloy Analyzer 4.2_2015-02-22*.
* Electrum models have been developed and analyzed under the *Electrum Analyzer 0.1*., and subsequently tested for support under version *1.2*.
* TLA+ models have been developed and analyzed under TLC 2.07 (and TLA Toolbox 1.5.1).
